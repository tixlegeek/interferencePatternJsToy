        Simple and dirty JS toy which lets you play with interference patterns.

        This code is absolutely not finished, or cleaned up, any help would be much appreciated :)

      <h2>About physics:</h2>
      <p>
        I can't say it's a physics-accurate representation. I made that for quick testings, but, i guess i now have to think about the "simulation" side. For example, you can't yet simulate reverberation, diffraction, etc... just isotropic emmiters, with a Frequency, a Phase, and an Amplitude (which you can tweak). You also can try to move them around, but, beware, the selector is a ring-buffer, so using it is a pain in the ass.

        UI design is ongoing. Have fun!
