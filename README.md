## About the code

This code have been initiated on 05-03-2020. It has been coded in a jiffy. It's pure vanilla JS, without any dependency or hardware magic. 

## About Physics accuracy

This is not a physics-accurate simulation. The results are approximated following simple statements:

* Each emmitters have parameters that you can set:

  * Frequency
  * Phase
  * Amplitude (power)

  All those property are only quantitative.

* At each point of the graph, the signal is approximated using:
  
  (Sorry, github's Latex renderer is non-existent )
  $$
  \sum_{E=1}^{nE}sin({Ed_i\times Ef_i - Ep_i})\times \dfrac{1}{Ed_i\times Ea_i}
  $$
  â€‹	with:
  $$
  Edi = \sqrt{(x_i-Ex_i)^2+(y_i-Ey_i)^2)}
$$
  

  These are bad mathematical transcription of the "sum of each  emitter's signal amplitude at given point ($$i$$)
  
  whatever, because, the code is so simple and dirty you could have found out yourself.

In some words: You cannot simulate refraction/diffraction/etc. It's mostly just a toy.

# About the UI

The UI is awful for now, but some people offered to try their magic on this thing. I only needed this for myself, and did not planned to share it, so i did not made any efforts about that.
